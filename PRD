# Interactive Experiments - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
"Interactive Experiments" is a showcase platform designed to document and display a collection of frontend animation and interaction experiments. The platform serves as both a portfolio and a learning tool, allowing the creator to maintain a directory of mini applications that demonstrate various frontend techniques and effects.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The project consists of a main landing page that provides easy navigation to individual experiments. Each experiment is a self-contained interactive demonstration focusing on specific frontend techniques such as animations, physics simulations, or unique user interactions.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Create a centralized location to document and display frontend experiments.
- Provide a consistent, user-friendly interface for browsing experiments.
- Allow filtering and searching of experiments by characteristics.
- Enable rapid development of new experiments.
- Showcase technical skills and creative approaches to frontend development.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Libraries**: Various based on experiment needs (e.g., p5.js, Three.js)

### 2.2 Architecture
- **Monorepo Structure**: A single codebase containing all experiments and shared components.
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular components that can be reused across experiments.
- **Directory Structure**:
  ```
  interactive-experiments/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── experiments/          # Individual experiment components
  │   ├── pages/                # Main application pages (home, about)
  │   └── shared/               # Shared components, hooks, and styles
  ├── public/                   # Static assets
  └── scripts/                  # Utility scripts
  ```

### 2.3 Responsiveness
- The platform must work on desktop and tablet screens.
- Experiments should adjust dynamically to different viewport sizes.
- Core interactivity should remain functional across supported devices.

## 3. User Interface Requirements

### 3.1 Landing Page
- Thumbnail grid display of all available experiments.
- Search functionality to filter experiments by name or description.
- Tag filtering system to find experiments by technique or feature.
- Consistent card design for each experiment with title, description, and thumbnail.

### 3.2 Experiment Pages
- Consistent layout with experiment title and description.
- Navigation to return to the main directory.
- Full-viewport experiment display area.
- Optional controls relevant to each experiment.

### 3.3 Visual Design
- Clean, minimal interface that emphasizes the experiments.
- Dark mode by default with good contrast ratios.
- Typography that prioritizes readability.
- Subtle animations for UI transitions.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Browsing & Navigation
- Users must be able to browse all experiments from the main landing page.
- Users must be able to filter experiments by tags and search terms.
- Users must be able to navigate back to the landing page from any experiment.
- URL structure must allow direct linking to specific experiments.

### 4.2 Experiment Framework
- Each experiment must be self-contained within its own module.
- Experiments must clean up resources when unmounted to prevent memory leaks.
- Experiments should include appropriate controls for user interaction.
- Canvas-based experiments must properly resize with their containers.

### 4.3 Tagging System
- Each experiment must have at least one tag describing its techniques or features.
- Tags must be filterable on the landing page.
- Multiple tags can be selected to refine the experiment list.

## 5. Experiment Requirements

### 5.1 General Requirements
- Each experiment must focus on demonstrating a specific frontend technique.
- Experiments must include appropriate comments and documentation.
- Interactions should be intuitive and responsive.
- Performance must be optimized, especially for animation-heavy experiments.
- Fallbacks or error messages should be provided for unsupported browsers.

### 5.2 Planned Experiments
- **Interactive Keyboard Layout**: Characters arranged in keyboard layout with hover effects.
- **Particle System Generator**: Customizable particle effects system.
- **[Placeholder for future experiments]**: Additional experiments will be added incrementally.

### 5.3 Experiment Documentation
Each experiment should include:
- Clear title and description.
- List of technologies/techniques used (tags).
- Representative thumbnail.
- Brief explanation of the interaction available.

## 6. Development Process

### 6.1 Version Control
- Git repository with main branch plus feature branches for new experiments.
- Meaningful commit messages documenting changes.
- README documentation for setup and contribution.

### 6.2 Experiment Creation
- Utility script to scaffold new experiments with boilerplate code.
- Standard metadata format for experiment documentation.
- Automated process to regenerate the experiment directory when new ones are added.

### 6.3 Testing and QA
- Manual testing on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Performance testing for animation-heavy experiments.
- Accessibility check for color contrast and keyboard navigation.

## 7. Deployment and Hosting

### 7.1 Build Process
- Vite build process to compile and optimize the application.
- Static site output for easy deployment.

### 7.2 Hosting Options
- Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or similar static hosting service.
- Custom domain optional but recommended for portfolio purposes.

## 8. Future Enhancements

### 8.1 Potential Features
- User comments or feedback mechanism for each experiment.
- Performance metrics and frame rate display for animation experiments.
- Code view option to see the implementation of each experiment.
- Dark/light theme toggle.
- Export/sharing capabilities for experiment results.
- Expand to include tutorials or explanations of techniques.

## 9. Success Criteria
